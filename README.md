# ⚠️ I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CATEGORY OF MACHINE LEARNING I'M USING!
 Take everything with a grain of salt **(but also please tell me what is wrong)**

# Genetic Algorithms in my own words
 This AI is trained using a **Genetic Algorithm**. In my own words, it is a method of machine learning to train a **Neural Network** based off the best Neural Network of each generation.
 Multiple AIs are initialized with random values in there Neural Networks

# Learn about Neural Networks:
 - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi (I learned most of the fundamental ideas here)
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU (I learned the most from this)
 - https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html (I didn't read this, I'm just including it so you don't have to search any further)

 (I don't recommend learning from Brilliant.org because it is *extremely* slow and basic at the start)
